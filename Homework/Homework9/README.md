# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

This project contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.

## Data Structures Implemented

1. **Stack**: Implements a stack data structure with push, pop, and peek operations.
2. **Queue**: Implements a queue data structure with enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
3. **Binary Tree**: Implements a binary tree data structure with insertion, search, and traversal operations.
4. **Graph**: Implements a graph data structure with methods for adding vertices, edges, and performing depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
5. **Singly Linked List**: Implements a singly linked list data structure with methods for insertion, deletion, and searching.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path in a graph from a given source vertex using Dijkstra's algorithm.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Finds the shortest path in a graph from a given source vertex using BFS.
3. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Check**: Checks if a binary tree satisfies the binary search tree property.
4. **Cycle Detection in Linked List**: Detects if a linked list contains a cycle using Floyd's cycle detection algorithm.

## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own JavaScript class. You can use these classes by creating instances and invoking their methods as demonstrated in the provided code examples.

## Examples

The `homework9.js` file contains sample code demonstrating the usage of each data structure and algorithm implemented in this project.
